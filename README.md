# Social-Network-API

## Description

My motivation to build this project was to learn how social media apis work because of the booming social media industry.  The reason I built this was to show what I have learned and to put it in action.  The problem it solves is loneliness by creating a environment where people can gather online to become friends and share thoughts.  I learned MongoDB, NoSQL, Models, and Schemas
